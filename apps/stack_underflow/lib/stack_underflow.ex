  @moduledoc """
  While continuing your work at Instruments of Texas, there is progress being
  made on the Elixir implementation of the RPN calculator. Your team would like
  to be able to raise errors that are more specific than the generic errors
  provided by the standard library. You are doing some research, but you have
  decided to implement two new errors which implement the _Exception Behaviour_.

  Tasks:

  1. Error for Division by Zero
  2. Error when encountering stack underflow
  3. Write a dividing function
