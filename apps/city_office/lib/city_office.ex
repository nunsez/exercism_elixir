defmodule CityOffice do
  @moduledoc """
  You have been working in the city office for a while, and you have developed
  a set of tools that speed up your day-to-day work, for example with filling
  out forms.

  Now, a new colleague is joining you, and you realized your tools might not be
  self-explanatory. There are a lot of weird conventions in your office, like
  always filling out forms with uppercase letters and avoiding leaving fields
  empty.

  You decide to write some documentation so that it's easier for your new
  colleague to hop right in and start using your tools.

  Tasks:

  1. Document the purpose of the form tools
  2. Document filling out fields with blank values
  3. Document splitting values into lists of uppercase letters
  4. Document checking if a value fits a field with a max length
  5. Document different address formats
  6. Document formatting the address
