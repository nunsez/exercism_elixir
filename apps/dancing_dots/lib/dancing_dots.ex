defmodule DancingDots do
  @moduledoc """
  Your friend, an aspiring artist, reached out to you with a project idea. Let's
  combine his visual creativity with your technical expertise. It's time to
  dabble in generative art!

  Constraints help creativity and shorten project deadlines, so you've both
  agreed to limit your masterpiece to a single shape - the circle. But there's
  going to be many circles. And they can move around! You'll call it... dancing
  dots.

  Your friend will definitely want to come up with new elaborate movements for
  the dots, so you'll start coding by creating an architecture that will allow
  you to later define new animations easily.

  Tasks:

  1. Define the animation behaviour
  2. Provide a default implementation of the `init/1` callback
  3. Implement the `Flicker` animation
  4. Implement the `Zoom` animation
